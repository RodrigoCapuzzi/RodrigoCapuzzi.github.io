        <p>
            Graduated in Civil Engineering from São Paulo State University (UNESP). During college, I did research (Scientific Initiation Program) in the area of transport, using Machine Learning to forecast the growth of metropolitan regions, on which I wrote and published two scientific articles. After graduation, I worked as a Data Analyst in the operations sector of Banco Itaú.
            After that, I left my position to do social volunteer work in Germany and study the German language. Now I am back in Brazil and I have started my second bachelor in the <b>IT field</b> where I develop research in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
